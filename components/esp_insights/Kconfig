            Enable ESP Insights functionality.

            This automatically selects log wrapping (DIAG_ENABLE_WRAP_LOG_FUNCTIONS) which is
            required for ESP Insights to capture log messages.

        help
            This option enables core dump summary functionality in insights.
            In case of crash, insights sends the core dump summary to cloud on next boot.
            Once the core dump summary is sent to cloud, it is erased from flash partition of the device.

            By default insights can send data to cloud using MQTT and HTTPS transports.
            This option configures the default insights transport.
            Insights transport can be overridden using esp_insights_transport_register API.

            Enabling this option adds control of certain insights options remotely.
            When enabled, the available configurations, should be shown on the dashboard
            and controllable from there.
            Please note, the feature is only available with RainMaker MQTT nodes for now.

        help
            Minimum interval between two consecutive cloud posts.
            There is a dynamic logic to decide the next timeout when the insights data will be reported.
            It depends on whether the data was sent or not during the previous timeout.
            If the data was sent, the next timeout is doubled and if not, it is halved.

            For users already using older metadata, this provides an option to keep using the same.
            This is important as the new metadata version (1.1), is not backwad compatible.
